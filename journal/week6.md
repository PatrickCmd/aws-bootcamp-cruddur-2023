# Week 6 â€” Deploying Containers

## AWS Containers

### Types of Container Services in AWS
1. Virtual Machines: Hosting containers in avirtual server (EC2)
2. Managed services
    - Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)
    - Fargate
    _ Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

## Deploying an Application to a Container using AWS ECS
### Types of Launch types to AWS ECS
- Amazon EC2 architecture
- Amazon ECS architecture
- Fargate (serveless architecture)

- Cloud Control Plane Configuration - Access Control, Container Images etc
- Choosing the right Public or Private ECR for images.
- Amazon ECR Scan Images to `Scan on Push` using Basic or Enhanced(Inspector + Snyk)
- Use VPC Endpoints or Security Groups with known sources only
- Amazon Organizations SCP - to manage ECS Task deletion, ECS creation, region lock etc
- AWS CloudTrail is enabled and monitored to trigger alerts on malicious ECS behaviour by an identity in AWS.
- AWS Config Rules (as no GuardDuty (ECS) even in Mar'2023) is enabled in the account and region of ECS

### Amazon ECS Security Best Practices - Application
- Access Control - Roles or IAM Users for ECS Clusters/Services/Tasks
- Most recent version of ECR Agent daemon on EC@
- Container Control Plane Configuration - Root privileges, resource limitations etc
- No secrets/passwords in ECS Task Definitions e.d db password etc - Consider AWS Secret Manager
- Only use Trusted Containers from ECR with no HIGH/CRITICAL Vulnerabilities
- Limit ability to ssh into EC2 container to read only file systems - use APIs or GitOps to pull information for troubleshooting
- Amazon CloudWatch to monitor Malicious ECS Configuration Changes
- Only using Authorized Container Images (hopefully some Image signing in the future e.g sigstore)
