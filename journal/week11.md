# Week 11 â€” CloudFormation Part 2

## AWS CloudFormation Backend-Flask Service Layer

See the cloudformation implementation for the service template [here](../aws/cfn/service/template.yaml)


This is a CloudFormation service template for deploying an AWS Fargate service. It defines various parameters and resources necessary for creating the service. Let's go through the template:

- The `AWSTemplateFormatVersion` specifies the CloudFormation version to use for the template.
- The `Description` provides a brief description of the template and its components.
- The `Parameters` section defines input parameters for the template that can be passed in at deployment time. These include networking and cluster stacks, service CPU and memory, container and task names, environment variables, and secrets.
- The `Resources` section defines the AWS resources to be created. In this case, it creates an ECS Fargate service and a task definition.
- The `FargateService` resource defines the ECS service configuration. It specifies the ECS cluster, Fargate launch type, desired count, and load balancer target group. It also defines the network configuration for the service, including subnets and security groups. Additionally, it specifies the service discovery configuration, including the service name, port name, and client aliases.
- The `TaskDefinition` resource defines the task definition for the ECS service. It specifies the task family, execution role, and task role. It also defines the container definitions, including the image, name, and essentiality. 

This template is just an example and may require modifications based on the specific requirements of the application being deployed.

The `TaskDefinition` section under `Resources` in this AWS CloudFormation template defines the task definition for the Fargate service that is being created. A task definition is a blueprint that describes the container and task configuration required to run a single instance of a task in Amazon ECS. 

The `Type` property specifies the type of AWS resource, which in this case is an `AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition`.

The `Properties` section contains various properties that define the task definition. 

- `Family`: Specifies the name of the family to which the task definition belongs, which is a string value and is specified in the `TaskFamily` parameter. 
- `ExecutionRoleArn`: Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role that grants the Amazon ECS container agent permission to make AWS API calls on your behalf. The ARN is obtained by calling the `!GetAtt` intrinsic function with the logical ID of the `ExecutionRole` resource, which is defined later in the CloudFormation template.
- `TaskRoleArn`: Specifies the ARN of the IAM role that the task requires to execute. The ARN is obtained by calling the `!GetAtt` intrinsic function with the logical ID of the `TaskRole` resource, which is defined later in the CloudFormation template.
- `NetworkMode`: Specifies the network mode to use for the task. In this case, `awsvpc` is specified, which is the recommended network mode for Fargate tasks.
- `Cpu`: Specifies the number of CPU units to reserve for the container. The value is obtained from the `ServiceCpu` parameter.
- `Memory`: Specifies the amount of memory (in MiB) to allocate to the container. The value is obtained from the `ServiceMemory` parameter.
- `RequiresCompatibilities`: Specifies the compatibility requirements for the task. In this case, `FARGATE` is specified, which means that the task can only run on AWS Fargate.
- `ContainerDefinitions`: Specifies an array of container definitions for the task. In this case, there is only one container definition, which is for the `backend-flask` container. 

  - `Name`: Specifies the name of the container, which is `backend-flask`.
  - `Image`: Specifies the Docker image to use for the container. The value is obtained from the `EcrImage` parameter.
  - `Essential`: Specifies whether the container is essential. In this case, `true` is specified, which means that if the container fails, the task fails.
  - `PortMappings`: Specifies an array of port mappings for the container. In this case, there is only one port mapping, which maps the container port to the host port. The container port is obtained from the `ContainerPort` parameter.
  - `Environment`: Specifies an array of environment variables for the container. In this case, there are several environment variables, such as `EnvOtelServiceName` and `EnvAWSCognitoUserPoolId`, which are obtained from the corresponding CloudFormation parameters.
  - `Secrets`: Specifies an array of secrets for the container. In this case, there are several secrets, such as `SecretsAWSAccessKeyId` and `SecretsSecretAccessKey`, which are obtained from the corresponding AWS Secrets Manager parameters.


**ExecutionRole Resource**

      ManagedPolicyArns:
        - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchLogsFullAccess
```

The `ExecutionRole` section under `Resources` in this AWS CloudFormation service template defines an IAM role that will be assumed by the ECS task execution IAM role to grant permissions required for running the ECS task. The ECS task execution IAM role is used by the Amazon ECS service to run the containers in the task definition.

The `ExecutionRole` resource has a type of `AWS::IAM::Role`. It has a `Path` property that specifies the path for the role's ARN. The `AssumeRolePolicyDocument` property is used to define the permissions that allow the ECS task execution IAM role to assume this role. The `PolicyDocument` property defines the permissions that are granted to this role. 

In this template, the `ExecutionRole` resource has a `Path` property set to `/`. The `AssumeRolePolicyDocument` property is defined using an AWS policy language that allows the ECS task execution IAM role to assume this role. Specifically, the policy allows any AWS service to assume this role if the service includes `ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com` in its `Service` field.

The `PolicyDocument` property of the `ExecutionRole` resource defines permissions for the execution role. This policy allows the ECS task to write logs to CloudWatch Logs, pull Docker images from the Amazon ECR repository, and perform Amazon SSM operations to retrieve secrets from the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. It also includes permissions to allow the ECS task to send tracing information to AWS X-Ray.

In summary, the `ExecutionRole` section in this template is creating an IAM role that grants permissions to the ECS task execution IAM role to assume the role, and to perform necessary actions like writing logs, pulling Docker images, and retrieving secrets.

In the provided CloudFormation service template, the `TaskRole` section under `Resources` defines an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that is used by the tasks launched by the ECS service to perform specific operations or access specific resources during their execution. 

Here is a breakdown of the properties and their functions:

- `Type`: The AWS CloudFormation resource type being created, which is `AWS::IAM::Role`.

- `Properties`: The properties for the `AWS::IAM::Role` resource.

  - `AssumeRolePolicyDocument`: A required property that specifies the permissions that the task role grants to the ECS task execution role to assume the task role. 

  - `Path`: An optional property that specifies the path in the IAM hierarchy where the role is created.

  - `Policies`: An optional property that specifies the policies that are attached to the role. 

    - `PolicyName`: The name of the policy. 

    - `PolicyDocument`: A JSON document that contains the permissions that are granted to the role.

In this template, the `TaskRole` resource allows the ECS tasks launched by the Fargate service to access the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) parameters that contain sensitive information, such as access keys and secrets, without granting them permissions to access the SSM service itself. The policy attached to the `TaskRole` resource grants permissions to read the specific SSM parameters containing the sensitive information. 

Overall, the `TaskRole` resource plays an important role in ensuring the security and integrity of the AWS resources accessed by the ECS tasks launched by the Fargate service.
