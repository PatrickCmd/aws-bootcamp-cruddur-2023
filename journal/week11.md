## AWS CloudFormation Database (RDS) Layer

See the cloudformation implementation for the database layer [here](../aws/cfn/rds/template.yaml)

This is an AWS CloudFormation template for creating a Postgres RDS Database in AWS. 

The first part of the template is the description section where the purpose of the template is explained. It creates an RDS instance, database security group, and a database subnet group. 

The `Parameters` section defines the input parameters that will be used when the stack is created. These parameters include the base layer of networking components like VPC and subnets, the Fargate cluster, backup retention period, DB instance class, DB instance identifier, DB name, deletion protection, engine version, master username, and master user password. 

The `Resources` section defines the AWS resources that will be created. It includes a security group, subnet group, and an RDS instance. The `RDSPostgresSG` resource creates a security group that allows incoming traffic from the Fargate cluster on port 5432. The `DBSubnetGroup` resource creates a subnet group that includes the public subnets of the networking stack. Finally, the `Database` resource creates the actual RDS instance. It uses the parameters defined earlier to specify the database settings like the allocated storage, backup retention period, DB instance class, DB instance identifier, DB name, deletion protection, engine version, master username, and master user password. 

Overall, this template can be used to create a Postgres RDS database with the specified settings in AWS.

```

The `Parameters` section in the CloudFormation database template defines input parameters for the template. These parameters allow users to pass values into the CloudFormation stack at the time of stack creation or stack update. 

In the template shown, there are several input parameters defined:
- `NetworkingStack`: This parameter is of type string and represents the name of the networking stack that contains the VPC and subnets that this database instance should be deployed into. The default value is `CrudderNet`.
- `ClusterStack`: This parameter is of type string and represents the name of the Fargate cluster stack that will access this database instance. The default value is `CrudderCluster`.
- `BackupRetentionPeriod`: This parameter is of type number and represents the number of days that automated backups of the database should be retained. The default value is `0`, meaning no automated backups will be retained.
- `DBInstanceClass`: This parameter is of type string and represents the size of the RDS instance to be created. The default value is `db.t4g.micro`.
- `DBInstanceIdentifier`: This parameter is of type string and represents the unique identifier for the RDS instance. The default value is `cruddur-instance`.
- `DBName`: This parameter is of type string and represents the name of the initial database to be created on the RDS instance. The default value is `cruddur`.
- `DeletionProtection`: This parameter is of type string and represents whether or not the RDS instance should have deletion protection enabled. The default value is `true`.
- `EngineVersion`: This parameter is of type string and represents the version of the PostgreSQL engine that will be used. The default value is `15.2`.
- `MasterUsername`: This parameter is of type string and represents the username for the master user of the RDS instance.
- `MasterUserPassword`: This parameter is of type string and represents the password for the master user of the RDS instance. The `NoEcho` attribute is set to `true` to prevent the password from being displayed in plain text in the CloudFormation console or logs. 

Each parameter is given a default value, but these can be overridden when the stack is created or updated by the user.

**RDSPostgresSG Resource**

```yaml
RDSPostgresSG:
    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group.html
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupName: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}RDSSG"
      GroupDescription: Public Facing SG for our Cruddur ALB
      VpcId:
        Fn::ImportValue:
          !Sub ${NetworkingStack}VpcId
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          SourceSecurityGroupId:
            Fn::ImportValue:
              !Sub ${ClusterStack}ServiceSecurityGroupId
          FromPort: 5432
          ToPort: 5432
          Description: ALB HTTP
```

The `RDSPostgresSG` resource in the CloudFormation template is an AWS EC2 Security Group that will be created as part of the CloudFormation stack deployment. 

The purpose of this security group is to allow inbound traffic from the ALB (Application Load Balancer) to access the Postgres RDS (Relational Database Service) instance that will be created in this template.

Here are the key properties of the `RDSPostgresSG` resource:

- `Type`: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
- `GroupName`: A unique name for the security group, which is formed by concatenating the CloudFormation stack name with the string "RDSSG".
- `GroupDescription`: A description for the security group.
- `VpcId`: The ID of the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) where the security group will be created.
- `SecurityGroupIngress`: A list of ingress rules that control inbound traffic to the security group. In this case, there is only one rule, which allows inbound traffic from the ALB security group on port 5432 (the default port for Postgres). 

Note that the ALB security group is referenced using the `Fn::ImportValue` function to import the ID of the security group. This is because the ALB security group is created in a separate CloudFormation stack (which is assumed to have been deployed prior to this stack) and its ID is exported using the `Export` attribute. 

By allowing inbound traffic only from the ALB security group, this security group follows the principle of least privilege, which helps to minimize the attack surface of the RDS instance.


**DBSubnetGroup Resource**

```yaml
DBSubnetGroup:
    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-rds-dbsubnetgroup.html
    Type: AWS::RDS::DBSubnetGroup
    Properties:
      DBSubnetGroupName: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}DBSubnetGroup"
      DBSubnetGroupDescription: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}DBSubnetGroup"
      SubnetIds: { 'Fn::Split' : [ ','  , { "Fn::ImportValue": { "Fn::Sub": "${NetworkingStack}PublicSubnetIds" }}] }
```

The `DBSubnetGroup` resource in the CloudFormation template is used to create a database subnet group for the Amazon RDS DB instance. A DB subnet group is a collection of subnets that you can choose to use when you create a DB instance in a VPC. 

The `DBSubnetGroup` resource has the following properties:

- `DBSubnetGroupName`: A name for the DB subnet group. It must be unique within the account and region. The name should be descriptive of the purpose of the subnet group.
- `DBSubnetGroupDescription`: A description for the DB subnet group.
- `SubnetIds`: A comma-separated list of subnet IDs that are used to create the DB subnet group. These subnets should be in different Availability Zones.

In this CloudFormation template, the `DBSubnetGroup` resource is defined with the properties to use the subnets created in the Networking stack. Specifically, the subnet IDs are retrieved from the `NetworkingStack` Parameter and the list of subnet IDs is created using the `Fn::Split` function and the `ImportValue` function to get the subnet IDs from the Networking stack's output.


**Database Resource**

```yaml
Database:
    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-rds-dbinstance.html
    Type: AWS::RDS::DBInstance
    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html
    DeletionPolicy: 'Snapshot'
    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatereplacepolicy.html
    UpdateReplacePolicy: 'Snapshot'
    Properties:
      AllocatedStorage: '20'
      AllowMajorVersionUpgrade: true
      AutoMinorVersionUpgrade: true
      BackupRetentionPeriod: !Ref  BackupRetentionPeriod
      DBInstanceClass: !Ref DBInstanceClass
      DBInstanceIdentifier: !Ref DBInstanceIdentifier
      DBName: !Ref DBName
      DBSubnetGroupName: !Ref DBSubnetGroup
      DeletionProtection: !Ref DeletionProtection
      EnablePerformanceInsights: true
      Engine: postgres
      EngineVersion: !Ref EngineVersion

      MasterUsername:  !Ref MasterUsername
      # Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 128 characters.
      MasterUserPassword: !Ref MasterUserPassword
      PubliclyAccessible: true
      VPCSecurityGroups:
        - !GetAtt RDSPostgresSG.GroupId
```

The `Database` resource in the CloudFormation template represents the RDS (Relational Database Service) instance that will be created. It defines the instance's properties, such as the allocated storage, DB instance class, DB name, DB subnet group, engine, engine version, master username and password, and the publicly accessible attribute.

Here's a breakdown of the properties:

- `AllocatedStorage`: Specifies the storage size in GB for the database. The minimum storage size is 20 GB.
- `AllowMajorVersionUpgrade`: Specifies whether major version upgrades are allowed for the database.
- `AutoMinorVersionUpgrade`: Specifies whether minor version upgrades are applied automatically to the database during the maintenance window.
- `BackupRetentionPeriod`: Specifies the number of days to retain automated backups. If set to 0, backups are disabled.
- `DBInstanceClass`: Specifies the instance class for the database.
- `DBInstanceIdentifier`: Specifies a unique identifier for the database instance.
- `DBName`: Specifies the name of the database to create on the instance.
- `DBSubnetGroupName`: Specifies the DB subnet group to associate with the database instance.
- `DeletionProtection`: Specifies whether deletion protection is enabled for the database. If enabled, the database cannot be deleted.
- `EnablePerformanceInsights`: Specifies whether performance insights are enabled for the database.
- `Engine`: Specifies the name of the database engine.
- `EngineVersion`: Specifies the version of the database engine.
- `MasterUsername`: Specifies the name of the master user for the database.
- `MasterUserPassword`: Specifies the password for the master user. The value is passed as a parameter with `NoEcho` attribute set to `true`.
- `PubliclyAccessible`: Specifies whether the database instance is publicly accessible or not.
- `VPCSecurityGroups`: Specifies the list of security groups to associate with the database instance.

The `Database` resource also includes two important attributes: `DeletionPolicy` and `UpdateReplacePolicy`. The `DeletionPolicy` specifies what happens to the resource when the stack is deleted. In this case, it's set to 'Snapshot', which means the instance is deleted, but a final snapshot of the database is retained. The `UpdateReplacePolicy` specifies what happens to the resource when its properties are changed. In this case, it's set to 'Snapshot', which means a new instance is created and data from the old instance is copied to the new instance.

## AWS CloudFormation Backend-Flask Service Layer

See the cloudformation implementation for the service template [here](../aws/cfn/service/template.yaml)


This is a CloudFormation service template for deploying an AWS Fargate service. It defines various parameters and resources necessary for creating the service. Let's go through the template:

- The `AWSTemplateFormatVersion` specifies the CloudFormation version to use for the template.
- The `Description` provides a brief description of the template and its components.
- The `Parameters` section defines input parameters for the template that can be passed in at deployment time. These include networking and cluster stacks, service CPU and memory, container and task names, environment variables, and secrets.
- The `Resources` section defines the AWS resources to be created. In this case, it creates an ECS Fargate service and a task definition.
- The `FargateService` resource defines the ECS service configuration. It specifies the ECS cluster, Fargate launch type, desired count, and load balancer target group. It also defines the network configuration for the service, including subnets and security groups. Additionally, it specifies the service discovery configuration, including the service name, port name, and client aliases.
- The `TaskDefinition` resource defines the task definition for the ECS service. It specifies the task family, execution role, and task role. It also defines the container definitions, including the image, name, and essentiality. 

This template is just an example and may require modifications based on the specific requirements of the application being deployed.

The `TaskDefinition` section under `Resources` in this AWS CloudFormation template defines the task definition for the Fargate service that is being created. A task definition is a blueprint that describes the container and task configuration required to run a single instance of a task in Amazon ECS. 

The `Type` property specifies the type of AWS resource, which in this case is an `AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition`.

The `Properties` section contains various properties that define the task definition. 

- `Family`: Specifies the name of the family to which the task definition belongs, which is a string value and is specified in the `TaskFamily` parameter. 
- `ExecutionRoleArn`: Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution role that grants the Amazon ECS container agent permission to make AWS API calls on your behalf. The ARN is obtained by calling the `!GetAtt` intrinsic function with the logical ID of the `ExecutionRole` resource, which is defined later in the CloudFormation template.
- `TaskRoleArn`: Specifies the ARN of the IAM role that the task requires to execute. The ARN is obtained by calling the `!GetAtt` intrinsic function with the logical ID of the `TaskRole` resource, which is defined later in the CloudFormation template.
- `NetworkMode`: Specifies the network mode to use for the task. In this case, `awsvpc` is specified, which is the recommended network mode for Fargate tasks.
- `Cpu`: Specifies the number of CPU units to reserve for the container. The value is obtained from the `ServiceCpu` parameter.
- `Memory`: Specifies the amount of memory (in MiB) to allocate to the container. The value is obtained from the `ServiceMemory` parameter.
- `RequiresCompatibilities`: Specifies the compatibility requirements for the task. In this case, `FARGATE` is specified, which means that the task can only run on AWS Fargate.
- `ContainerDefinitions`: Specifies an array of container definitions for the task. In this case, there is only one container definition, which is for the `backend-flask` container. 

  - `Name`: Specifies the name of the container, which is `backend-flask`.
  - `Image`: Specifies the Docker image to use for the container. The value is obtained from the `EcrImage` parameter.
  - `Essential`: Specifies whether the container is essential. In this case, `true` is specified, which means that if the container fails, the task fails.
  - `PortMappings`: Specifies an array of port mappings for the container. In this case, there is only one port mapping, which maps the container port to the host port. The container port is obtained from the `ContainerPort` parameter.
  - `Environment`: Specifies an array of environment variables for the container. In this case, there are several environment variables, such as `EnvOtelServiceName` and `EnvAWSCognitoUserPoolId`, which are obtained from the corresponding CloudFormation parameters.
  - `Secrets`: Specifies an array of secrets for the container. In this case, there are several secrets, such as `SecretsAWSAccessKeyId` and `SecretsSecretAccessKey`, which are obtained from the corresponding AWS Secrets Manager parameters.

```

The `ExecutionRole` section under `Resources` in this AWS CloudFormation service template defines an IAM role that will be assumed by the ECS task execution IAM role to grant permissions required for running the ECS task. The ECS task execution IAM role is used by the Amazon ECS service to run the containers in the task definition.

The `ExecutionRole` resource has a type of `AWS::IAM::Role`. It has a `Path` property that specifies the path for the role's ARN. The `AssumeRolePolicyDocument` property is used to define the permissions that allow the ECS task execution IAM role to assume this role. The `PolicyDocument` property defines the permissions that are granted to this role. 

In this template, the `ExecutionRole` resource has a `Path` property set to `/`. The `AssumeRolePolicyDocument` property is defined using an AWS policy language that allows the ECS task execution IAM role to assume this role. Specifically, the policy allows any AWS service to assume this role if the service includes `ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com` in its `Service` field.

The `PolicyDocument` property of the `ExecutionRole` resource defines permissions for the execution role. This policy allows the ECS task to write logs to CloudWatch Logs, pull Docker images from the Amazon ECR repository, and perform Amazon SSM operations to retrieve secrets from the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. It also includes permissions to allow the ECS task to send tracing information to AWS X-Ray.

In summary, the `ExecutionRole` section in this template is creating an IAM role that grants permissions to the ECS task execution IAM role to assume the role, and to perform necessary actions like writing logs, pulling Docker images, and retrieving secrets.

```

In the provided CloudFormation service template, the `TaskRole` section under `Resources` defines an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that is used by the tasks launched by the ECS service to perform specific operations or access specific resources during their execution. 

Here is a breakdown of the properties and their functions:

- `Type`: The AWS CloudFormation resource type being created, which is `AWS::IAM::Role`.

- `Properties`: The properties for the `AWS::IAM::Role` resource.

  - `AssumeRolePolicyDocument`: A required property that specifies the permissions that the task role grants to the ECS task execution role to assume the task role. 

  - `Path`: An optional property that specifies the path in the IAM hierarchy where the role is created.

  - `Policies`: An optional property that specifies the policies that are attached to the role. 

    - `PolicyName`: The name of the policy. 

    - `PolicyDocument`: A JSON document that contains the permissions that are granted to the role.

In this template, the `TaskRole` resource allows the ECS tasks launched by the Fargate service to access the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) parameters that contain sensitive information, such as access keys and secrets, without granting them permissions to access the SSM service itself. The policy attached to the `TaskRole` resource grants permissions to read the specific SSM parameters containing the sensitive information. 

Overall, the `TaskRole` resource plays an important role in ensuring the security and integrity of the AWS resources accessed by the ECS tasks launched by the Fargate service.
