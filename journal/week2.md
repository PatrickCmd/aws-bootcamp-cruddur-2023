# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

- Followed instructor's journal [here](https://github.com/omenking/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-2/journal/week2.md) and week-2 playlist to implement distributed tracing with different third parties, honeycomb, rollbar, aws cloudwatch logs and aws x-ray.
- Went through and read [Olley's blog](https://olley.hashnode.dev/aws-free-cloud-bootcamp-instrumenting-aws-x-ray-subsegments) to see how to implement AWS X-Ray segments and subsegments.
